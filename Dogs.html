  <h1>These are my dogs!</h1>
  <p>I have two dogs - Loki and Bailey</p>

  <p>This is Loki! We got him in 2021 after our black lab passed. He was a total ball of mischief, hence the name Loki. He is our dog of mischief: </p>

  <p>This is Bailey! We got her last summer on a whim. She is a total goofball of a dog and barks a TON: </p>
